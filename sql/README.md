# SQL analysis

This folder contains SQL case studies.
- SQL queries (CTEs, joins, aggregations, window functions when relevant)

## AdventureWorks SQL Data Analysis 
Project is organized into two levels of analysis:
**adventureworks_sql_analysis.sql**

Collection of core queries used to understand the dataset structure and business context:
- product overview
- operational activity
- cost and revenue checks
- basic aggregations and filtering

## Advanced Analysis
Focused analyses addressing specific business questions:

1_1_adventureworks_customer_overview.sql

1_2_adventureworks_top500_ active_customer_overview.sql

2_1_adventureworks_sales_numbers.sql

These queries address specific business questions rather than general exploration.
